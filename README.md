# MyFirstProject
Hello everyone!
I'm studying Java and Python for developing apps. For now, I know more Java than Python so only for practice, I did this project alone.
It's a simple diary. It was develop with Java for improve my POO's knowledge.

There are 8 files in total. The main is in "MyDiary.java" file. There are comments throughout the code for better understanding.
In the "Event" file I created an abstract class that specializes in two classes: "ImportantEvent" and "NormalEvent". The difference between both are, for now, insignifcant, because only change the color. I don't implement that part of the code yet.
The class "MenuUtils" has the menu's prints and the options management basically.
In "MenuOne" there are only two methods. One that create and sets the events by it priority, and the other that returns that event. 
"MenuTwo" is the class that prints the events that the user had created already. The user can choose if he/she wants to view only important events, only normal events, all of them or by day.
The last file is the file that keeps the Strings that shows in the program. There are also two methods, one that check the String is not null or empty. Another method is the method that ask the user to enter a String.

I hope everything was clear.
I know the code is not very clean and omtimized and for sure it can do better and easier but I did my best!

Thank you everyone.
